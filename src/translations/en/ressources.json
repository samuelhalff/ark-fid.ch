      "description": "A summary of the main rules and attention points for annual VAT settlement in 2025.",
      "content": "For the 2025 tax year, Swiss businesses must continue to use either the **effective method** (based on 4 VAT returns) or the **Net Tax Rate (NTR) method** (2 VAT returns), as previously applied.\n\n## Key features of the annual VAT settlement\n\n- Changing your VAT settlement method requires notifying the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (AFC) at the start of each fiscal period, within 60 days (for 2026: between 01.01.2026 and 28.02.2026 for a first change). The new method must be kept for at least one full fiscal period for businesses with turnover below CHF 5,005,000.\n- Other conditions: all tax debts must be fully paid and all returns submitted on time for the previous three fiscal periods.\n- The AFC determines the amount of advance payments, invoiced in three installments. These can be adjusted up to 10 days before the relevant due date.\n- Deadline extensions remain possible.\n- The AFC may revoke authorization if:\n  - It has had to initiate debt collection against the taxpayer,\n  - The taxpayer has exceeded the CHF 5,005,000 turnover limit for three consecutive periods,\n  - The AFC has had to estimate taxes due to missing returns.\n\n## Attention points\n\n- If advance payments are too low, late interest (4.5%) will be charged.\n- No possibility to claim input tax refunds based on advance payments.\n- Authorization may be revoked if advance payments deviate too much from actual amounts due.\n- If there is a tax credit, it can only be refunded the following year (in March).\n",
