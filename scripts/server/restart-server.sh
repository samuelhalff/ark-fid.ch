# Managed restart for ark-fid.ch. Installed to $BASE/shared/ by the deploy
# pipeline (shipped inside the release artifact, copied by the extract step).
#
# Invoked over ssh as a single command string — the only reliable exec channel
# on this host (stdin-fed sessions drop; see repo deploy notes). Replaces the
# old flow of kill-endpoint + fixed sleeps: stops the supervisor by pidfile,
# frees the port, starts exactly one new supervisor, and waits until the local
# port answers before returning.
